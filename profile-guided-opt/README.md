# Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)

Concept: Use a profiler to identify bottlenecks and guide optimization.

Scenario: We can't provide a direct code example that uses PGO within Go source code, as PGO is a compiler feature. However, I can show how you would generate a profile and what kind of code you'd then optimize based on the profile.

## Steps

### Run with Profiling

Compile and run your Go application with CPU and/or memory profiling enabled.

```bash
go build -o myapp .
./myapp -cpuprofile cpu.prof -memprofile mem.prof
# Or, for web servers, use pprof handlers:
# import _ "net/http/pprof"
# go func() { log.Println(http.ListenAndServe("localhost:6060", nil)) }()
# Then access http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/
# And use `go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30`
```

### Analyze Profile

Use go tool pprof to analyze the generated profile.

```bash
go tool pprof cpu.prof
# (pprof) top
# (pprof) web (generates SVG call graph)
```

### Identify Bottleneck

pprof will show you which functions consume the most CPU time or allocate the most memory.

### Optimize the Hotspot

Focus your optimization efforts on those specific functions.
